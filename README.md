About Me:
Hi I'm commonly known as Luck and I'm completing my Masters of Data Science but I have a passion for programming and creating mini projects in my spare time.
This is all done as part of a humble learning journey!

About this project:
I do love chess + I love coding so why not try practicing my Python skills relating to tkinter and OOP? The inspiration started out with seeing ArjanCodes' chess refactoring video in my Subscriptions tab: https://youtu.be/n0i4SqjQdis

So I challenged myself to try to code a version of Chess without watching the video and then come back to look at it when I decided I've done a fair bit of work.

22/10/22 - And right after this commit, despite being far off from a fully functioning chess game with all the logic inputted, I have decided to consult the video and see how different our solutions are. Pretty amazed and will take inspiration from here to refactor the chess and continue from then on again!
